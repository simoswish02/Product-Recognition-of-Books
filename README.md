# Product-Recognition-of-Books
This repository implements a traditional computer vision system for automatic book recognition on library and bookstore shelves. Given a reference image for each book, the system locates and identifies all instances of that book within real shelf scene images — using only classical computer vision techniques, without any deep learning.
